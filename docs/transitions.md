### Titanium 5.2.0: Android Activity & Shared Element Transitions

Android 5.0 (API level 21) introduced [Material Design](http://developer.android.com/design/material/index.html): a vision, [design guidelines](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html) as well as new components and animations. Earlier in Titanium 5.1.0 we added support for [CardView](https://github.com/appcelerator-developer-relations/appc-sample-ti510#cardview), the [Reveal Effect](https://github.com/appcelerator-developer-relations/appc-sample-ti510#reveal-effect) animation as additional support for the [material design theme](https://github.com/appcelerator-developer-relations/appc-sample-ti510#progressbar-color).

Now in Titanium 5.2.0 we add support for customized [Activity & Shared Element Transitions](https://developer.android.com/training/material/animations.html#Transitions). In this blog post I'll walk you through this using the new [Titanium 5.2.0 Sample App](http://github.com/appcelerator-developer-relations/appc-sample-ti520):

#### What is an Activity?
In Titanium each Window or TabGroup creates and is linked to a new [Activity](http://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities.html). When the user presses the [system back button](http://developer.android.com/training/implementing-navigation/temporal.html) he will return to the previous activity on the stack. You can access the Activity via the [activity property](http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/api/* `Ti.UI.Window-property-activity).

#### What is a Transition?

It's important to understand the difference between the different transitions an activity goes through that you can customize. You can see all four of them explained in the following diagram:

![Transition Lifecycle](assets/transitions.png)

As you go from Window A to B, Window A will **exit** and B will **enter**. When you press the system back button to return to Window A, then Window B will **return** and A will **reenter**.

> **NOTE:** It's a known issue that when you programmatically close a Window using its `close()` method the **return** and **exit** transition for that Window is ignored ([TIMOB-20451](https://jira.appcelerator.org/browse/TIMOB-20451)). The system back button shows the expected behaviour.

For more details I recommend Alex Lockwood's [Getting Started with Activity & Fragment Transitions](http://www.androiddesignpatterns.com/2014/12/activity-fragment-transitions-in-android-lollipop-part1.html).

#### Activity Transitions

To customize the transitions you can use the following properties:

* `Ti.UI.Window.activityExitTransition`
* `Ti.UI.Window.activityEnterTransition`
* `Ti.UI.Window.activityReturnTransition`
* `Ti.UI.Window.activityReenterTransition`

> **NOTE:** Unfortunately the API reference of these properties currently has them located under the Window `open()` and `close()` [parameters](http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/api/openWindowParams) ([TIDOC-2454](https://jira.appcelerator.org/browse/TIDOC-2454)). Also don't let the old `activity*Animation` properties for these methods confuse you ([TIMOB-20498](https://jira.appcelerator.org/browse/TIMOB-20498)). Just follow this walkthrough. ðŸ˜›

These can be set to the following constants:

* [`Ti.UI.Android.TRANSITION_EXPLODE`](http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/api/Titanium.UI.Android-property-TRANSITION_EXPLODE)
* [`Ti.UI.Android.TRANSITION_FADE_IN`](http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/api/Titanium.UI.Android-property-TRANSITION_FADE_IN)
* [`Ti.UI.Android.TRANSITION_FADE_OUT`](http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/api/Titanium.UI.Android-property-TRANSITION_FADE_OUT)
* [`Ti.UI.Android.TRANSITION_SLIDE_TOP`](http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/api/Titanium.UI.Android-property-TRANSITION_SLIDE_TOP)
* [`Ti.UI.Android.TRANSITION_SLIDE_RIGHT`](http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/api/Titanium.UI.Android-property-SLIDE_RIGHT)
* [`Ti.UI.Android.TRANSITION_SLIDE_BOTTOM`](http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/api/Titanium.UI.Android-property-SLIDE_BOTTOM)
* [`Ti.UI.Android.TRANSITION_SLIDE_LEFT`](http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/api/Titanium.UI.Android-property-SLIDE_LEFT)
* [`Ti.UI.Android.TRANSITION_NONE`](http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/api/Titanium.UI.Android-property-TRANSITION_NONE)

The sample lets you [set these properties](app/views/android/transitions_a.xml#L8) from within the app so you can play with the available properties and constants.

##### Transition Fallbacks
In most cases you will only set **enter** and **exit** because **reenter** will fall back to **exit** as will **return** to **enter**. Both of these will fall back to the Android material or custom theme you use. If you use the shared elements we come to talk about later they will default to **fade**.

##### Disable Transitions
You can disable transitions at all time by passing `{animated:false}` to the Window `open()` or `close()` method.

#### Shared Element Transitions
Again Alex Lockwood does a great job at explaining working with [Shared Elements](http://www.androiddesignpatterns.com/2015/01/activity-fragment-shared-element-transitions-in-depth-part3a.html).

What it comes down to is that as you transition from one Window to the next you can link individual related views between both Windows and have them transform as if they were the same.

If you scroll back to the screenrecording of our Sample App you can see that the Appcelerator logo and the next underneath display this behaviour. Again, the sample allows you to change the transition style for these shared elements.

##### Available Properties

Again, we have four different properties we can set. Their names might be very similar to those for the Activity Transitions, but their meaning is slightly different.

> **NOTE:** Unfortunately the API reference of these properties currently has them located under the Window `open()` and `close()` [parameters](http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/api/openWindowParams) ([TIDOC-2454](https://jira.appcelerator.org/browse/TIDOC-2454)).

Let's start with two properties you would set on Window B:

* `Ti.UI.Window.activitySharedElementEnterTransition` to determine how shared elements transition from A to B. It defaults to **change bounds**.
* `Ti.UI.Window.activitySharedElementReturnTransition` to determine how shared elements transition form B to A. It defaults to **change bounds**.

Additionally you can also set two properties on Window A. Now as Alex points out there are very use cases for these two. In fact, with the transition animations Titanium currently exposes setting them will not be noticeable.

* `Ti.UI.Window.activitySharedElementExitTransition` is performed **before** the shared elements transition from A to B using the **enter** transition.
* `Ti.UI.Window.activitySharedElementReeenterTransition` is performed **after** the shared elements have transitioned from B to A using the **return** transition. It defaults to the **exit** transition.

##### Available constants

The constants you can use for these transitions are:

* [`Ti.UI.Android.TRANSITION_CHANGE_BOUNDS`](http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/api/Titanium.UI.Android-property-TRANSITION_CHANGE_BOUNDS)
* [`Ti.UI.Android.TRANSITION_CHANGE_CLIP_BOUNDS`](http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/api/Titanium.UI.Android-property-TRANSITION_CLIP_BOUNDS)
* [`Ti.UI.Android.TRANSITION_CHANGE_TRANSFORM`](http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/api/Titanium.UI.Android-property-TRANSITION_CHANGE_TRANSFORM)
* [`Ti.UI.Android.TRANSITION_CHANGE_IMAGE_TRANSFORM`](http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/api/Titanium.UI.Android-property-TRANSITION_CHANGE_IMAGE_TRANSFORM)
* [`Ti.UI.Android.TRANSITION_NONE`](http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/api/Titanium.UI.Android-property-TRANSITION_NONE)

##### How to define shared elements?

Now how do we put these properties and constants into use and actually define shared elements?

1. In both Windows we need to set the new [transitionName](http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/api/Titanium.UI.View-property-transitionName) property to the same value for each shared element. You can see we've done this in [Window A](app/views/android/transitions_a.xml#L66-L67) and [Window B](app/views/android/transitions_b.xml#L7-L9) of our Sample App. The name should be unique within each Window.
2. Before we open Window B we then need to use its new [addSharedElement()](http://docs.appcelerator.com/platform/latest/#!/api/Titanium.UI.Window-method-addSharedElement) method. This method takes two properties. The first should be a reference to the shared view in Window A. The second is the value of `transitionName` as it can be found in Window B. Sounds confusing? Have a look at the Sample's [transition_a.js](app/controllers/android/transitions_a.js#L30-L31) controller.

Let's make some truly *animating* Titanium Android apps!
